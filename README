Class of data structures that can be unfolded.

Just as there's a Foldable class, there should also be an Unfoldable class. 
This package provides one. Example unfolds are:

 * Random values
 * Enumeration of all values (depth-first or breadth-first)
 * Convert from a list
 
Some examples can be found in the examples directory.
