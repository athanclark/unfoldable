Class of data structures that can be unfolded.

Just as there's a Foldable class, there should also be an Unfoldable class.
This package provides one. Example unfolds are:

* Random values
* Enumeration of all values (depth-first or breadth-first)
* Convert from a list

Some examples can be found in the examples directory.
